Contribution Guideline
---

## Project introduction

Thank you for considering contributing to this kata!

This kata goal is to provide a workbase on containerization on which 
people would be able to experiment. 

It's made of two singles app forming together a quote-picker backend once put together. 
So people can have fun around them, try to containerize them with different tooling, 
learn about containerization using them etc... etc...

The [Readme](https://github.com/khantzen/container-kata) is mostly there 
as a kick off to offer some basic exercice you can do from this workbase.

## What kind of contributing this project need

- Any new backend/frontend language is welcomed.
- Fixing bad english too...

## Guidelines

So you'll find below some guideline this project try to follow.

### This is not a tutorial!

There's a lot of tools to work with container. 

This project don't intend to teach people how those tool works
but to provide them an application that could _looks like_ something running in production.

Also contributing should not give any solution on the exercices.

### Backend projects should be unit tested

Not necessarily a 100% coverage but we want users to be able to run some unit testing using container.

### Backend projects should follow the api spec'

Api Spec can be found in [Api Spec Readme](https://github.com/khantzen/container-kata/blob/main/backend/README.md)

### Projects (backend and frontend) should have a `How to run` section in their README

This project assume that user don't necessarily know how to build & run a project developped in a certain language.

To assist them the backends project README file should contain an `How to run` section with the following information.

- How to build the application (for compiled language)
- How to launch application unit test
- How to get the application running

### The `quotes`Â directory should be externalized from the code

The idea is to have the user explicitely adding the quotes in the container image.

### You should be able to do the Readme containerization exercice for any new project.

We don't want to provide people something not made for containerization

### Be Decent!

Stay respectful and caring!
